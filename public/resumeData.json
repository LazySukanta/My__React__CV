I am focused and learning new things excites me. My passion in life is to gain knowledge. Knowledge gives you power to be right and better than others.I don't fear failures or rejections they are ways to enrich you and glorify your personality. Failures are experiences you gain from your mistakes.I aspire to be an excellent Software Engineer and use my skills to make something productive and helpful for the nation. MY greatest strength is my positive attitude , even during the most hardest of times. My only weakness is to never give up no matter how hard things hit me , how much they destroy me I accept them as a challenge and don't let them break me.",
